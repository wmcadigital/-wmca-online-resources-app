However, as consumer confidence begins to grow, it is important that retail support staff are fully trained and equipped to represent your business and to meet the needs of your customers. As removing staff from the ‘shop floor’ applies pressure to rotas, this training can be carried out in the learner’s own time via our tried and tested flexible learning approach. Course Content: Develop understanding of the different aspects of the retail industry Learn about customer payments and the selling process Understand how to provide good customer service Learn how to deal with queries and complaints Gain an understanding of basic retail law and the importance of correct stock control",
